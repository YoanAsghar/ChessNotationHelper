                        Ever thought learning chess board notation was boring or frustrating? <br>Well, I thought the same â€” that's why I created this page to make it easier and more fun for you. <br><br>See the Start button at the bottom of the screen? <br>When you press it, the program will give you a random square on the board. Your goal is to click the correct square to score a point. <br><br>You can turn the notations on and off to help you find your way around, but I recommend turning them off as you improve to get more familiar with the board. <br><br>By default, you're playing from White's perspective, but there's also an option to flip the board so you can train from Black's side too. <br><br>Honestly, I'm not sure why you're still reading this â€” it's all pretty intuitive! <br>
                        Hope it helps you, and enjoy learning. ðŸ™‚
